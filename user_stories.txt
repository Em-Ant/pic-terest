Build a Pinterest Clone

    Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://pintech.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
    Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-back-end-development-projects.
    Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
    User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.
    User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
    User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
    User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
    User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
    User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
    Hint: Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
    Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
    You can get feedback on your project from fellow campers by sharing it in our Code Review Chatroom. You can also share it on Twitter and your city's Campsite (on Facebook).
